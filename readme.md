# @typed/virtual-dom

A collection of exhaustive TypeScript typings that can be reused across many 
virtual-dom projects, particularly those which use hyperscript for their markup.

These types were originally written for [`mostly-dom`](https://github.com/TylorS/mostly-dom)
but can an should be broadly applicable as well all deal with the same DOM interfaces.

All types have been mostly collected directly from MDN and additional online resources
like W3C standards documents. Nothing marked as obsolete or experimental technology not
supported by all major browser vendors have been added to these types.
